**Please [sign up on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6590109/) if you will be attending.**

An opportunity to learn and share knowledge and stories about how you use Python, how you'd like to use it, cool features of the language, open source projects you've used, deployment, war stories, philosophy, [Zen](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), or anything remotely related to Python.

Each talk will last approximately 5-15 minutes. They can be as structured or unstructured as you like - slides are optional. **If you'd like to speak, please [drop me a quick email](mailto:jamie.matthews@gmail.com) with your name and a very brief description of your topic**, and I'll add you to the list. 

It would be nice to get as many speakers as we can. The event is intended to be fun and informal, so don't worry if you've never talked at an event before. Just turn up and enjoy yourself!

This list is incomplete, and will be expanded before the day!

#### Jamie Matthews - the Flask web framework ####

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a fun but powerful 'microframework' which allows you to develop small-to-medium-sized apps very quickly using a tiny amount of code. It's used to power the [BrightonPy website](http://brightonpy.org).
