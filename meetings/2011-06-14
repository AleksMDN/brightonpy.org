**Please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/brightonpy-python-show-and-tell/) if you will be attending.**

It's time for another Python Show and Tell. An opportunity to learn and share knowledge and stories about how you use Python, how you'd like to use it, cool features of the language, open source projects you've used, deployment, war stories, philosophy, Zen, or anything remotely related to Python.

We'll also be discussing plans for a BrightonPy Hack Day sometime over the summer, so if you have any ideas for things to work on, come along to chat.

**If you'd like to speak, please [drop me a quick email](mailto:jamie.matthews@gmail.com) with your name and a very brief description of your topic**
