[Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com) is a moderately complex web application. The core site uses [Django](http://djangoproject.com/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), but we also make use of [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), [Redis](http://redis.io), [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/), [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/), [Celery](http://celeryproject.org/) and [Fabric](http://fabfile.org/). This talk will discuss the challenges involved in building large web applications using a variety of powerful open source components.
