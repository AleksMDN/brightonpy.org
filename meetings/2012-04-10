Django, the web framework for "perfections with deadlines", is used to power such mega-huge sites as Instagram and Disqus, is rapidly gaining popularity in the world of web development as a solid but flexible base for building modern web applications.

Tonight's meeting will consist of several short-to-medium length talks from long-time Django users with hints and tips about various aspects of building high-performance, maintainable Django sites. It will also include an overview of new features in the recently released [Django 1.4](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/mar/23/14/).
